      <description>&lt;p&gt;GitHub is not only a cool community for developers who can create teams, share code, and even make friends, but it also provides free tools for people who like to toss around ideas. &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#about-github-pages&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; is such a fancy service where you can easily setup your own websites by just a few mouse clicks. Companies and project teams can easily create product homepages on it, and individuals who like to document things and share ideas can also easily build blogs on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
